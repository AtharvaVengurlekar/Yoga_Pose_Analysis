# Yoga Pose Recognition 🧘‍♀️

A deep learning project to recognize yoga poses from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This application leverages TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Numpy to classify yoga poses into predefined categories. 

---

## Project Overview 📋

The system is designed to recognize yoga poses from images, enabling users to identify and analyze poses effectively. It includes functionalities for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and pose prediction.

---

## Key Features 🚀

- **Yoga Pose Classification**: Identify yoga poses such as *Adho Mukha Svanasana*, *Halasana*, *Trikonasana*, and more.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Standardize images by resizing, normalizing, and one-hot encoding labels.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Built using a CNN architecture for high accuracy in pose recognition.
- **Data Augmentation**: Apply techniques like rotation, flipping, and shifting for a robust dataset.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Predict yoga poses from new images using the trained model.

---

## Project Structure 📁

- **Data Collection**: Yoga pose images organized into folders by class.
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Resizing images to 128x128.
  - Normalization of pixel values.
  - One-hot encoding of class labels.
- **Model Training**:
  - Sequential CNN model with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
  - Early stopping to prevent overfitting.
  - Data augmentation for enhanced performance.
- **Evaluation**: Model accuracy and loss calculated on validation data.
- **Pose Prediction**: Predict yoga poses from unseen images.

## How to Use 🖥️

### 1. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Place your dataset in the specified folder structure:  
     ```
     dataset_path/
     ├── Adho Mukha Svanasana/
     ├── Halasana/
     ├── Trikonasana/
     └── Other_Poses/
     ```
   - Update the `dataset_path` in the script with the correct path to your dataset.

### 2. **Train the Model**
   - Run the training script to build the CNN model:
     ```bash
     python yoga_pose_training.py
     ```

### 3. **Predict Yoga Poses**
   - Provide an image to the model for prediction:
     ```bash
     python yoga_pose_prediction.py --image <path_to_image>
     ```

### 4. **Evaluate the Model**
   - Use the validation dataset to check accuracy:
     ```bash
     python yoga_pose_evaluation.py
     ```

---

## Results 📊

- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of **XX%** on the validation dataset.
- **Sample Predictions**: Correctly identified yoga poses for various test images.

---

## Future Enhancements 🔮

- Integrate the model into a mobile or web application for real-time yoga pose recognition.
- Expand the dataset to include more yoga poses and variations.
- Improve performance with advanced deep learning architectures.
