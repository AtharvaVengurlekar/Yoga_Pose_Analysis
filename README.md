Here’s a tailored **README.md** for your **Yoga Pose Recognition** project:

```markdown
# Yoga Pose Recognition 🧘‍♂️

A deep learning project designed to recognize yoga poses from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This system provides accurate classification of yoga poses, helping users identify and analyze postures effectively.

---

## Key Features 🚀

- Recognize multiple yoga poses such as:
  - Adho Mukha Svanasana
  - Halasana
  - Trikonasana
  - Other poses
- Image preprocessing for standardization.
- Deep learning model trained with TensorFlow and Keras.
- Real-time prediction capabilities using OpenCV.
- Data augmentation for improved model performance.

## How to Use 🖥️

### 1. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Place your dataset in the specified folder structure:  
     ```
     dataset_path/
     ├── Adho Mukha Svanasana/
     ├── Halasana/
     ├── Trikonasana/
     └── Other_Poses/
     ```
   - Update the `dataset_path` in the script with the correct path to your dataset.

### 2. **Train the Model**
   - Run the training script to build the CNN model:
     ```bash
     python yoga_pose_training.py
     ```

### 3. **Predict Yoga Poses**
   - Provide an image to the model for prediction:
     ```bash
     python yoga_pose_prediction.py --image <path_to_image>
     ```

### 4. **Evaluate the Model**
   - Use the validation dataset to check accuracy:
     ```bash
     python yoga_pose_evaluation.py
     ```

## Results 📊

- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of **XX%** on the validation dataset.
- **Sample Predictions**: Correctly identified yoga poses for various test images.

---

## Future Enhancements 🔮

- Integrate the model into a mobile or web application for real-time yoga pose recognition.
- Expand the dataset to include more yoga poses and variations.
- Improve performance with advanced deep learning architectures.
