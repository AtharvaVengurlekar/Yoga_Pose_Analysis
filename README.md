Got it! Here’s how the **README.md** will look for your **Yoga Pose Recognition** project based on Jupyter Notebook usage:

```markdown
# Yoga Pose Recognition 🧘‍♀️

## Getting Started with Jupyter Notebook 📓

This project uses **Jupyter Notebook** to implement and execute all steps, from data preparation to pose recognition.

---

## Setup Virtual Environment
1. Create a virtual environment using `venv` or `conda`:
   ```bash
   python -m venv /path/to/your/environment/
   ```

2. Activate the environment:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\path\to\your\environment\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source /path/to/your/environment/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install Jupyter and required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

---

## Installation of Dependencies
Run the following command to install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, manually install:
```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

---

## Dataset Preparation 🗂️
1. Structure your dataset as follows:
   ```
   dataset_path/
   ├── Adho Mukha Svanasana/
   ├── Halasana/
   ├── Trikonasana/
   └── Other_Poses/
   ```
2. Update the dataset path variable in your Jupyter Notebook (`Yoga_Pose_Recognition.ipynb`).

---

## Run the Notebook 🚀
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `Yoga_Pose_Recognition.ipynb`.

3. Execute the notebook cells step by step:
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - **Model Training**: Train a CNN model for pose recognition.
   - **Prediction**: Test the model with sample images.
   - **Evaluation**: Check the accuracy of the model.

---

## Features 🎯
- Recognizes poses like:
  - Adho Mukha Svanasana
  - Halasana
  - Trikonasana
  - Other Poses
- Implements **data augmentation** for improved accuracy.
- Interactive Jupyter Notebook workflow for ease of use.

---

## Results 📊
- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of **XX%** on the validation dataset.
- **Predictions**: Successfully identified poses from test images.

---

## Future Enhancements 🔮
- Integrate real-time yoga pose recognition using webcam.
- Add support for additional yoga poses.
- Convert Jupyter Notebook to a deployable web or mobile application.
